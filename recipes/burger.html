        <h1>The Best Hamburger</h1>

        <img src="../images/burger.jpg" alt="Hamburger">

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a great hamburger for the grill. Feta cheese gives it a rich and 
            creamy taste.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef </li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley </li>
            <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, 
                and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; 
                flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese 
                onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese
                 with one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal 
                 the cheese into the center.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your 
                desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 
                degrees F (70 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
